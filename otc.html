                <li>3/4 can of light beer</li>
                <li>Spices to taste:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cumin</li>
                        <li>Paprika</li>

                        <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>Favorite chili toppings for garnish</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>    
            <ol>
                <li>Start by cooking the veggies on the stove top. In a dutch oven or pan, add cooking oil and cook onion, bell pepper, garlic and jalapeño until softened. Add in spices and black beans. Mix together and let cook for 3 minutes until most of the moisture is out of the pan.</li>
                <li>Deglaze the pan with beer. Add in chopped tomatoes, fire roasted tomatoes and beef broth. Simmer.</li>
                <li>While this is simmering, heat up your smoker to 225 degrees. </li>
                <li>Then in a bowl, mix beef and Italian sausage and spices of choice. Form into large meatball.</li>
                <li>Put a wire rack on top of your dutch oven or pan and then place the meatball on top of the rack in your smoker.</li>
                <li>Cook at 225 until the meat reaches 155 degrees internal.</li>
                <li>Once it reaches 155 internal, remove the meat from the rack, break it apart, and put it into the chili. Cook for another 20-30 minutes (you can do this on the smoker or back on the stove). </li>
                <li>Garnish with your favorite chili toppings.</li>

            </ol>
